# Discount Calculator

A Python script to calculate the final price of an item after applying a discount. The program applies the discount only if it is 20% or higher; otherwise, it returns the original price.

## Features
- Accepts user input for the original price and discount percentage.
- Validates user input to ensure proper calculations.
- Calculates and applies a discount of 20% or higher.
- Displays the final price or informs the user if no discount was applied.

## How It Works
1. The user is prompted to enter:
   - The **original price** of the item.
   - The **discount percentage**.
2. The script calculates the final price using the `calculate_discount` function:
   - If the discount is **20% or higher**, the discount is applied.
   - Otherwise, the original price is returned.
3. The final price or original price is displayed.
